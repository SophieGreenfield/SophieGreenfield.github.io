# About

My formal art training began during the Foundation course at the Royal Drawing School in 2015. There is where I first started working with the idea of the ideal imaginary landscape, an idea that I’ve continued to work with since then.

Drawing is a huge part of my work and time at RDS really helped develop that. Focusing mainly on observational drawing, I enjoy combining my sketches into a whole new landscape of their own. Whether that’s transporting ornaments and toys to new landscapes entirely or making a whole new cityscape by bringing together separate street views, I look for the playful in the ordinary. My photography plays a similar role- looking for the hidden parts of the city and finding abstract forms through light.
 
At the moment, my work is looking at blending the figure with my interest in landscapes and cityscapes. My event photography began doing this in a more formal manner some years back and is still something I’m involved in. The more recent focus, however, has been drawing my way through the idea. For my MSc, I’m focusing on the creative industry in Accra, Ghana, marking a looping back to the arts in my academic career.
