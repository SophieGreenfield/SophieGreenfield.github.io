## GitHub Pages

GitHub pages provides deployment of your website in response to pushing changes to a repository on GitHub if the GitHub Pages environment is enabled.

See https://pages.github.com/.


### GitHub

GitHub itself provides hosting for version control of software using Git, i.e. it stores all the history of the changes you make to the website to allow you to roll back to older versions (among other things).
