## Jekyll

Jekyll is a static website generator - you write your site in a markup language (we're using markdown) and it converts it into HTML. It also provides the ability to use templates to avoid repitition.

GitHub Pages uses Jekyll to build websites. That is, it's possible to make changes and push to the GitHub repository to update the website without directly interacting with Jekyll at all. However, you won't generally want to make a change live without checking it looks ok first, in which case you will need to use Jekyll on your personal computer.
